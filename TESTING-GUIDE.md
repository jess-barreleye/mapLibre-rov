# Quick Start Guide: Testing Time-Travel Features

## Prerequisites

1. **InfluxDB Running:**
   - URL: http://10.23.9.24:8086
   - Bucket: openrvdas
   - Data available for ship (seapath380) and ROV (sb_sprint)

2. **Services Started:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Tile Server
   tileserver-gl --mbtiles ./maps/*.mbtiles --port 8080
   
   # Terminal 2: Frontend Server
   node server.js
   
   # Terminal 3: GPS Server (InfluxDB mode)
   cd gps-server
   node server-influxdb.js
   
   # Terminal 4: Telemetry Server (optional)
   cd rov-telemetry-server
   npm start
   ```

3. **Browser Open:**
   - Navigate to http://localhost:8000
   - Open browser DevTools console (F12) to see logs

## Feature 1: UTC Time Selector (Time Travel)

### Purpose
View ship and ROV positions at any specific moment in the past.

### Steps

1. **Locate the Control:**
   - Left sidebar → Expand "Historical Position"

2. **Select a Time:**
   - Click the "Select UTC Time" datetime picker
   - Choose a recent date/time (recommend within last 24 hours)
   - Example: Today at 12:00 PM

3. **Query Position:**
   - Click the blue "Go to Time" button
   - Watch console for: `[HISTORICAL] Querying position at...`

4. **View Results:**
   - Two blue circular markers should appear:
     - Ship (S) - at ship's position at selected time
     - ROV (R) - at ROV's position at selected time
   - Map automatically zooms to show both
   - Click markers to see popup with:
     - Exact timestamp
     - Coordinates
     - Heading, speed (ship) or depth (ROV)

5. **Return to Live:**
   - Click green "Back to Live" button
   - Historical markers disappear
   - Real-time red/green markers resume updating

### Expected Console Output
```
[HISTORICAL] Querying position at 2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z
[SHIP HISTORICAL] InfluxDB query completed
[ROV HISTORICAL] InfluxDB query completed
[HISTORICAL] Sent data for 2025-01-15T12:00:00.000Z
[HISTORICAL] Displayed positions {ship: {...}, rov: {...}}
```

### Troubleshooting
- **No markers appear:** Check that selected time has data in InfluxDB
- **"GPS WebSocket not connected":** Wait for connection or restart server-influxdb.js
- **Only one marker:** Normal if only one vehicle had data at that time

## Feature 2: Historical Trackline Date Range

### Purpose
Display complete vessel tracks between two dates, with automatic downsampling for performance.

### Steps

1. **Locate the Control:**
   - Left sidebar → Expand "Historical Tracklines"

2. **Set Date Range:**
   - **Start Time:** Click picker, select start date/time (UTC)
   - **End Time:** Click picker, select end date/time (UTC)
   - Recommendation: Start with 1-6 hour range for testing

3. **Select Vehicles:**
   - Check ☑ "Load Ship Track" (orange line)
   - Check ☑ "Load ROV Track" (green line)
   - Can load individually or together

4. **Load Track:**
   - Click blue "Load Historical Track" button
   - Watch status message:
     ```
     Loading ship track: 1/5
     Loading ship track: 2/5
     ...
     Loaded 4,237 points for ship
     ```

5. **View Results:**
   - Colored lines appear showing complete path
   - Map zooms to fit entire track
   - Track colors:
     - Ship: Orange (#FF6600) by default
     - ROV: Green (#00CC66) by default

6. **Customize Display:**
   - **Visibility:** Uncheck boxes to hide tracks
   - **Opacity:** Drag sliders (0 = transparent, 1 = solid)
   - **Color:** Click color boxes to change line colors

7. **Export Data:**
   - Click purple "Export as GeoJSON" button
   - File downloads: `historical-tracklines-2025-01-15.geojson`
   - Open in QGIS, ArcGIS, or text editor

8. **Clear Tracks:**
   - Click red "Clear Tracks" button
   - All historical tracks removed from map

### Expected Console Output
```
[TRACKLINE] Querying ship, rov from 2025-01-15T00:00:00.000Z to 2025-01-15T06:00:00.000Z
[TRACKLINE] Received ship chunk 1/5 (1000 points)
[TRACKLINE] Received ship chunk 2/5 (1000 points)
...
[SHIP TRACKLINE] Retrieved 4,237 points (5s resolution)
[TRACKLINE] ship complete: 4,237 points
[TRACKLINE] Rendered ship track: 4,237 points
[ROV TRACKLINE] Retrieved 2,891 points (5s resolution)
[TRACKLINE] rov complete: 2,891 points
[TRACKLINE] Rendered rov track: 2,891 points
```

### Downsampling Behavior

The system automatically adjusts resolution based on time range:

| Date Range | Aggregation | Expected Points (24hrs) |
|------------|-------------|-------------------------|
| < 1 hour | 1 second | ~3,600 points |
| 1-24 hours | 5 seconds | ~17,280 points |
| 1-7 days | 10 seconds | ~8,640 per day |
| > 7 days | 1 minute | ~1,440 per day |

**Example:**
- 1 hour query: Full resolution, ~3,600 points
- 6 hour query: 5-second aggregation, ~4,320 points
- 24 hour query: 5-second aggregation, ~17,280 points
- 7 day query: 10-second aggregation, ~60,480 points

### Troubleshooting
- **"Please select both start and end times":** Fill in both datetime pickers
- **"End time must be after start time":** Check date order
- **Status stuck on "Loading...":** Check server-influxdb.js console for errors
- **No tracks appear:** Verify data exists for selected date range
- **Very slow loading:** Normal for >7 day ranges; wait 30-60 seconds

## Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Time travel displays historical ship marker
- [ ] Time travel displays historical ROV marker
- [ ] Back to Live button removes historical markers
- [ ] Trackline loads ship track successfully
- [ ] Trackline loads ROV track successfully
- [ ] Trackline loads both tracks together

- [ ] Loading trackline while in historical mode works

### Performance
- [ ] 1-hour trackline loads in < 5 seconds
- [ ] 6-hour trackline loads in < 10 seconds

- [ ] 7-day trackline loads in < 60 seconds
- [ ] Browser remains responsive during loading
- [ ] Map renders tracks smoothly

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "GPS WebSocket not connected"
**Solution:** 
```bash
cd gps-server
node server-influxdb.js
# Wait for "[SHIP] WebSocket server listening on port 8081"
# Refresh browser
```

### Issue: No historical data appears
**Diagnosis:**
```bash
# Test InfluxDB connection
cd gps-server
node test-seapath.js
# Should show field names
```
**Solution:** Verify InfluxDB credentials in `.env` file

### Issue: Trackline loading takes forever
**Diagnosis:** Check date range duration
**Solution:** 
- For testing, start with 1-6 hour ranges
- Long ranges (>7 days) can take 30-60 seconds
- Check server console for query progress

### Issue: Exported GeoJSON is empty
**Diagnosis:** Tracks must be loaded before export
**Solution:**
1. Load tracklines first
2. Wait for "Loaded X points" status
3. Then click Export

### Issue: Historical markers hard to see
**Solution:**
- Zoom in closer to markers
- Blue markers are 40px circles with white border
- Click markers to see popups
- Markers appear on top of live markers

## Data Verification

### Check Historical Position Accuracy
1. Note timestamp from historical popup
2. Query InfluxDB directly:
   ```bash
   curl -G 'http://10.23.9.24:8086/api/v2/query' \
     -H "Authorization: Token YOUR_TOKEN" \
     --data-urlencode "org=834cb38b7a729cea" \
     --data-urlencode 'query=from(bucket: "openrvdas")
       |> range(start: 2025-01-15T12:00:00Z, stop: 2025-01-15T12:00:02Z)
       |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_measurement"] == "seapath380")
       |> filter(fn: (r) => r["_field"] == "Seapath_Latitude" or r["_field"] == "Seapath_Longitude")'
   ```
3. Compare coordinates with map popup

### Check Trackline Point Count
1. Load 1-hour trackline
2. Note point count: "Loaded X points"
3. Expected: ~3,600 points for 1 second resolution
4. If much lower: Check for data gaps in InfluxDB

## Browser Console Debugging

Useful commands to run in browser console:

```javascript
// Check WebSocket connection status
console.log('Ship GPS:', gpsWebSocketShip?.readyState); // 1 = OPEN

// Manual historical query
gpsWebSocketShip.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'queryHistorical',
  timestamp: '2025-01-15T12:00:00Z',
  vehicles: ['ship', 'rov']
}));

// Manual trackline query
gpsWebSocketShip.send(JSON.stringify({
  type: 'queryTrackline',
  startTime: '2025-01-15T00:00:00Z',
  endTime: '2025-01-15T06:00:00Z',
  vehicles: ['ship'],
  downsample: 'auto'
}));

// Check historical mode state
console.log('Historical mode:', isHistoricalMode);

// Check stored trackline data
console.log('Ship points:', historicalTracklines.ship.length);
console.log('ROV points:', historicalTracklines.rov.length);
```

## Success Criteria

The implementation is working correctly when:

1. ✅ Historical position query returns data for times with InfluxDB entries
2. ✅ Blue markers appear at correct coordinates
3. ✅ Trackline renders complete path between dates
4. ✅ Downsampling occurs automatically for long ranges
5. ✅ UI controls (visibility, opacity, color) work
6. ✅ Export produces valid GeoJSON file
7. ✅ No console errors during normal operation
8. ✅ Can switch between live and historical modes smoothly
